# DividendPayoutCalculator
I wanted to know how much it would cost to buy X number of shares at XYZ company and how many shares it would take to pay off an expense using only dividend payments. So, I created this dividend payout calculator in Excel, then moved it to Google Sheets to merge it with no-code app, Glide App.
